Message processing involves a broad spectrum of protocols, services, and standards. Here are some of the topics that can be investigated in more depth:

* Message format: To support seamless interoperability across protocols, IoT Hub defines a common message format for all device-facing protocols.
* Message routing: This IoT Hub feature enables users to route device-to-cloud messages to service endpoints like Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, Service Bus queues, and Service Bus topics. Routing also provides a querying capability to filter the data before routing it to the endpoints. In addition to device telemetry data, you can also send non-telemetry events that can be used to trigger actions.
* Event Grid: Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that uses a publish-subscribe model. IoT Hub and Event Grid work together to integrate IoT Hub events into Azure and non-Azure services, in near-real time. IoT Hub publishes device events, which are generally available, and now also publishes telemetry events, a feature that is currently in public preview.
* Message enrichment: Message enrichment is the ability of the IoT Hub to stamp messages with additional information before the messages are sent to the designated endpoint.
* Azure Stream Analytics: Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) is a real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine that is designed to analyze and process high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously. ASA supports inputs and outputs using a wide range storage options.
* Azure Functions: Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure and is a great solution for processing data, integrating systems, and working with the Internet-of-Things. Azure Functions provides several templates that will help you to get you started with key IoT scenarios.
* Warm and cold storage: For architectures that produce significant amounts of data, a common pattern is to split the data into “warm” and “cold” data stores. Traditionally, data stored in cold storage is accessed infrequently, while data stored in warm storage accessed frequently.
