## Azure IoT Edge is made up of three components:

- IoT Edge modules are containers that run Azure services, third-party services, or your own code. Modules are deployed to IoT Edge devices and execute locally on those devices.
- The IoT Edge runtime runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed to each device.
- A cloud-based interface enables you to remotely monitor and manage IoT Edge devices.
