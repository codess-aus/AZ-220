## Azure IoT Edge is made up of three components:

- IoT Edge modules are containers that run Azure services, third-party services, or your own code. Modules are deployed to IoT Edge devices and execute locally on those devices.
- The IoT Edge runtime runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed to each device.
- A cloud-based interface enables you to remotely monitor and manage IoT Edge devices.

## IOT Edge Runtime

## IoT Edge cloud interface

It's difficult to manage the software life cycle for millions of IoT devices that are often different makes and models or geographically scattered. Workloads are created and configured for a particular type of device, deployed to all of your devices, and monitored to catch any misbehaving devices. These activities can't be done on a per device basis and must be done at scale.
