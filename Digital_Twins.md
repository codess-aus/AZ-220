"Azure Digital Twins" refers to the Azure Digital Twins service as a whole. 
"Digital twin(s)" or just "twin(s)" refers to the digital entities represented within your solution.

Azure Digital Twins can be used to build customized, connected solutions that:

* Model any environment, and bring digital twins to life in a scalable and secure manner.
* Connect assets such as IoT devices and existing business systems.
* Use a robust event system to build dynamic business logic and data processing.
* Integrate with Azure data, analytics, and AI services to help you track the past and then predict the future.

Digital twins (in Azure Digital Twins) and device twins (in IoT Hub) may sound similar, but they are two different things. 
IoT Hub device twins often focus on describing the aspects and capabilities of a device itself, while digital twins are more conceptual representations that can store user-defined insights about a digital entity or many related entities (entities that could be representing a device or many related devices). 
It is also worth noting that IoT Hub device twins can be connected to Azure Digital Twins (the service) as part of an end-to-end solution that represents devices across services.
