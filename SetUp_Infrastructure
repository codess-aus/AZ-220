Set Up the IoT Solution Infrastructure (10-15%)

Azure IOT Hub on the Sl Standard tier: 
* This tier supports bi-directional (device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device) messaging
* The only pricing tier of Azure IOT Hub that supports the use of Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure IOT Hub on the Free tier: 
* This tier is mainly used for evaluation and testing 
* supports bi-directional messaging with IOT devices 
* Cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure IOT Hub on the B2 Basic tier: 
* This tier supports uni-directional (device-to-cloud) messaging only 
* It cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure Event Hub:
* Azure Event Hub supports device-to-cloud messaging
* You should use Azure IOT Hub for communication and management of IOT devices because of its additional security, monitoring, and provisioning capabilities
* Event Hub does not support cloud-to-device messaging 
* Cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

In the following example:
az group create -l westus -n RGOI 
az iot hub create -n Hub01 -g RGOI --sku Sl 

The -l parameter (a short form for the --location parameter) specifies the target Azure region, and westus is the value for West US. 
The -n parameter is a short form for the --name parameter in the az group create Azure CLI command. 
The -g parameter is a short form for --the resource-group parameter in the az iot hub create Azure CLI command. 
Example Sl as the value for the -sku parameter. This specifies one of the Standard pricing tiers for the new Azure IOT Hub.
