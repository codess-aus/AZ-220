Set Up the IoT Solution Infrastructure (10-15%)

Azure IOT Hub on the Sl Standard tier: 
* This tier supports bi-directional (device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device) messaging
* The only pricing tier of Azure IOT Hub that supports the use of Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure IOT Hub on the Free tier: 
* This tier is mainly used for evaluation and testing 
* supports bi-directional messaging with IOT devices 
* Cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure IOT Hub on the B2 Basic tier: 
* This tier supports uni-directional (device-to-cloud) messaging only 
* It cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

Azure Event Hub:
* Azure Event Hub supports device-to-cloud messaging
* You should use Azure IOT Hub for communication and management of IOT devices because of its additional security, monitoring, and provisioning capabilities
* Event Hub does not support cloud-to-device messaging 
* Cannot be used with Azure Security Center for IOT

In the following example:
az group create -l westus -n RGOI 
az iot hub create -n Hub01 -g RGOI --sku Sl 

The -l parameter (a short form for the --location parameter) specifies the target Azure region, and westus is the value for West US. 
The -n parameter is a short form for the --name parameter in the az group create Azure CLI command. 
The -g parameter is a short form for --the resource-group parameter in the az iot hub create Azure CLI command. 
Example Sl as the value for the -sku parameter. This specifies one of the Standard pricing tiers for the new Azure IOT Hub. 

Azure IOT Hub offers two subscription tiers, Basic (B) and Standard (S). 
Each tier offers different features. 
Each tier is further divided into three sizes, 1 through 3. 
The size determines the number of messages the hub can handle on a daily basis. 
You can purchase multiple units of the same size to scale up the daily message limit. 
S3 Standard supports up to 300,000,000 messages per day, per unit. 
Tier Sl Standard, 400,000 messages per day. 
Tier S2 standard, 6,000,000 messages per day. 

The az iot hub create command has two required parameters: name, and resource-group. 

The following command would create an IOT hub named ExampleHub in the ExampleRG resource group: 
az iot hub create --resource-group ExampleRG --name ExampleHub

--sku parameter. This optional parameter allows you to specify the pricing tier for the Azure IOT Hub. The default value is tier Sl. 
--retention-day parameter. This optional parameter allows you to specify how long a hub will store device-to-cloud events. The default value is one day. 
--only-show-errors parameter. This optional parameter allows you to suppress warnings and only show errors. The default is to show both warnings and errors.
